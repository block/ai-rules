# Debugging Guidelines

When debugging issues in this codebase:

1. **Check logs first** - Review application logs for error messages and stack traces
2. **Reproduce consistently** - Ensure you can reliably reproduce the issue before attempting fixes
3. **Isolate the problem** - Use binary search or divide-and-conquer to narrow down the root cause
4. **Add logging** - Insert temporary debug statements to trace execution flow
5. **Check recent changes** - Review recent commits that might have introduced the issue
